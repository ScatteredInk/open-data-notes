At Open Data Services, we are running a reading group to study issues around international tax, tax justice and illicit financial flows.

Things we have read/are reading:

- the Tax Justice Network's [Measuring Illicit Financial Flows](https://tax-justice-network.gitbooks.io/our-book-project/) book (which is being written in public).
