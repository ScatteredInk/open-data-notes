A site for notes on open data and transparency.

## What you will find here

Some of this is part of a reading group on tax justice and illicit financial flows that we are running at [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://opendataservices.coop/).

Some of this is part of my work on [beneficial ownership](https://github.com/openownership/data-standard) and corporate disclosures.

Some of this is on topics that I'm interested in and want to know more about, either because I'd like to work on them in the future or just because I think they are important.

## How to use this site

In general:

- The author's material and views are in the main text of a post.
- My comments, and any links I see to other materials, are in the margin notes.
